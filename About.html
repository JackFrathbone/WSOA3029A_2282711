            <h1>About Game State SA</h1>
            <h2>What Is the Purpose of GS?</h2>
            <p>
                Game State SA is an attempt to cleary visualise and tell a story through data. That story is about the
                growth and rise of the gaming and animation industry in South Africa, which has grown rapidly in a few
                years from a couple of studios to becoming a serious industry in this country. This site is dedicated to
                documenting the growth of the industry, both in terms of financial success but also it's geographic
                spread,
                in order to understand where the hubs of activity are. Through the use of visual, the hope is that the
                past, present and future of the gaming and animation industry can be cleary seen, and the work that
                needs to be done to continue building it should be clear.

            <h2>Where Is This Data Coming From?</h2>
            <p>
                While a variety of sources will be used, alongside specific research on companies and locations, the
                majority data on this site comes from a 2019 research report by the South African Cultural Observatory,
                which has done lots of the hard work documenting indepth the recent state of the industry and its
                historical growth. The credits section of this site will contain the source tables and data from which
                any graphs are compiled.
