                <h2>Close Reading of Communicating Data to an Audience</h2>
                <p>
                    This week's article is from the book Data-driven storytelling and is the chapter titled
                    ‘Communicating Data to an Audience’. This article looks at methods and forms of communication and
                    its limitations and strengths when it comes to conveying ideas about data (Drucker et al, 2018). The
                    introduction of the article begins by raising the question about how data can be effectively and
                    efficiently communicated, and how one may start thinking about methods of communicating data. They
                    raise that while knowing your audience can help make communication very effective, it can be
                    difficult to really know exactly who your audience will be and what their expectations will be,
                    especially when publishing to large audiences. So thinking more broadly about the type of audience
                    who will enjoy or benefit most from your data visualisation, you can break down broad types ie.
                    those with higher data literacy or those unfamiliar with certain graph conventions.
                    <br><br>
                    The next section breaks down broad ways the audience can relate to your data and how this can be
                    planned for by understanding very broad ideas like expectations and previous general conventional
                    knowledge of those who will see your work. Some examples of this are shown, such as historical
                    charts that needed explanation to their function because they were still new concepts, whereas most
                    people now see graphs in school and are more familiar with how they work. A key point of this
                    section is that expectations are very important to understand to build the most effective
                    communication practice.
                    <br><br>
                    The focus of the next section is on audience expectations, things that might be generally expected
                    and sought by audiences to help them understand your visualisation, including use of normal colors,
                    sizes and keys that guide the audience to understand the data without overcomplicating it. The
                    format of the data visualisation becomes very important in this regard, there are expected standards
                    for data being shown on paper, on television or online, and audiences expect these to follow the
                    conventions of the platform.
                    <br><br>
                    The chapter ends by looking back at all the different points made, and raises again that while
                    generally knowing the specific knowledge of your audience might be difficult or impossible, by
                    knowing conventions and expectations, data can clearly communicate to large audiences. Understanding
                    the broad limitations of groups of people, what they might have experience with or might never have
                    seen before.
