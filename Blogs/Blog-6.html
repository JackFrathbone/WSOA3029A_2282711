                    <br><br>
                    This week the focus will be looking at an interesting piece of visual data, from the website
                    Information is Beautiful(informationisbeautiful.net). This site hosts various different infographics
                    created by the site's team, from both professional and fun graphs and infographics that they create.
                    The one being looked at today will be a very interesting and unique infographic titled Varieties of
                    Intimate Relationships which is based on a very clunky older graph which breaks down various types
                    of relationships. The form of the graph is quite different to some of the other types of
                    visualisations looked at before in other blogs, being firstly not based on a data set, but also
                    being slightly more aesthetically strange yet appealing.
                    <br><br>
                    The main thing about this visual is that it is essentially a diagram made up of various connected
                    nodes, but the way it is laid out and connected really creates a sense of flow and helps show the
                    relations between various different points. It also definitely engages in storytelling through
                    visuals, such as in the one corner to emphasise serial monogamy it has a series of ever smaller
                    nodes that alternate between ‘single’ and ‘in a relationship’. This obviously demonstrates the point
                    but also fills up empty space on that side, so it is probably also a practical choice. But it really
                    is an interesting example about how categorising things can be done in an aesthetically interesting
                    way that can be informative simply through the layout, and not just the data or information
                    presented.
                    <br><br>
                    What is very interesting is that all nodes connect to three primary nodes, which are like fields
                    under which all the nodes fall under, and with each one using its own color, clearly defines the
                    boundaries between the different nodes. This use of color is also important on the connection points
                    because these bring the color of the previous node, and when one color enters into another's it
                    becomes obvious, and highlights overlaps. Another interesting visual is the central disconnected
                    node title ‘marriage’ which sits in the bottom centre surrounded by a bunch of end nodes, which also
                    have a slightly visual outline different from all the others. This works like a venn diagram, to
                    show how all these nodes overlap into the category of marriage while coming from separate origins.
                    <br><br>
                    Overall the communication of this infographic is very effective, because of how it blends clear but
                    appealing and distinct visuals with very clever use of order and structure. This makes it a good
                    tool for explaining these different categories clearly, and a good attempt at representing more
                    complex ideas simply.
