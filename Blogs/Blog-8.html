                <h2>Close reading and reflection on What is Interaction for Data Visualization?</h2>
                <p>
                    This week's reading is something that is useful for the work that needs to be done on the website.
                    What is Interaction for Data Visualization? is an article that straightforwardly explains the most
                    important aspects about moving beyond the purely visual forms of data visualization, and brings up
                    approaches that are used to make data visualizations interactive (Dimara & Perin, 2020). This
                    article is focused on how to define the idea of interactivity in relation to data visualisation,
                    what constitutes interaction and how it should be discussed and thought about when presenting data.
                    <br><br>
                    The article starts by looking generally at the historical use of the word ‘interactivity’ in
                    human-computer interaction, stating that there has been in the past an understanding that
                    interactivity can increase the value and engagement of data presentation, but that there is still a
                    general failure to understand and use interactivity in modern approaches to data visualization. This
                    idea shows how despite the possibilities that modern websites present, as well as powerful desktop
                    and phone applications, many visualisations still retain the same structure from the past and don't
                    make use of new technology. The next few sections of the article deal with the methodology that is
                    used to analyse and build the authors definition, including the use of surveys to see what various
                    experts thought were key parts of interaction, such as computer controllers like mice or even the
                    users previous knowledge when engaging with a data visualization.
                    <br><br>
                    From all of this initial data there are further attempts to bring together all the different ideas
                    on interaction, looking at the related field of human-computer interaction(HCI) which also struggles
                    with a clear definition of interactivity. This shows some core ideas from HCI on interaction such as
                    breaking down interaction into different areas like: dialogue, transmission, control, tool use,
                    optimal behaviour, embodiment and experience. When making their own definition for interaction, many
                    elements of the HCI definition are removed because interaction for data visualization does not have
                    the same requirements as the broader computer interactions.
                    <br><br>
                    This definition focuses on the response of the interface, in the form of action-reaction, to the
                    user's engagement with the data, and how it communicates ideas visually to the user that they then
                    engage with. This overall shows that interactivity isn't simply just having things for the user to
                    click on or scroll, but that simply with visual communication and a dynamic interface users can
                    interact with and engage more deeply with visualizations, which differs from analogue and print
                    forms of data visualization which contain less areas of interaction and engagement.
