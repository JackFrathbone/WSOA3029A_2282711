                <h2>A Close Reading of “Overview of Data Visualization” by Qi Li</h2>
                <p>
                    Data, the storage of information for various purposes, has always had an important place in human
                    society for organisation and understanding. In this chapter of Embodying Data by Qi Li, the author
                    discusses the history and uses of data visualization as a tool for understanding data. Breaking down
                    data visualization into a few categories, the first one brought up is traditional data visualization
                    which focuses on “communication for understanding” as its primary purpose (Li, 2020: 17).
                    Visualizing data can allow for large amounts of data to be made easily understandable, as well as
                    making clear trends in the data which can be difficult to understand without visual reference. The
                    ability of traditional data visualization is to make data and its trends, or emergent qualities,
                    easily accessible to wider audiences, or at least make vast incomprehensible data more
                    understandable for human analysis.
                    <br><br>
                    While data visualization has existed for a long time, and has had many analogue forms, the computer
                    age has allowed for a wide range of computer generated graphs, plots and infographics which easily
                    allow data to be visualised and follow shared standards. In both sharing data with the public and
                    for research this has become a common and very useful tool for sharing data. Because of its various
                    forms, there are some differing opinions on what exactly defines data visualization, from simply
                    being specifically computer generated images, to more broadly just being any visual representation
                    of data that aids in understanding of said data. Li also personally argues that a central part of
                    data visualization is the transformation of data into information, saying that while data is
                    organisation of raw information without meaning, it becomes information through visualization, that
                    is gaining meaning and becoming understandable. This creates a dichotomy of unprocessed information,
                    or data, and process information, with the visualization of some form being a key point of
                    transformation that is required to make data meaningful.
                    <br><br>
                    Li goes on in the chapter to list a variety of specific forms of data visualisations, such as
                    graphs, plots, volumes and maps. These all highlight how various datasets can be turned into visual
                    forms that take advantage of the specific type of information to be processed, and the best way to
                    make it readable. After showing these examples, the author then goes on to list what they believe
                    are the main characteristics of traditional data visualization: readability, recognizability and
                    meaning (Li, 2020: 41). This leads on to the next section which emphasizes the importance of human
                    perception in understanding data that has been visualised, raising some psychological examples of
                    theories of perception and attention, relating them to data visualisation.
                    <br><br>
                    Over Li raises many interesting points and perspectives on what can seem like a very obvious
                    concept, of course data needs to be visualised in some way to make it understandable for people, but
                    the actual reasons why and how it should be done play an important role. Li shows how useful a tool
                    data visuation is, and thus how necessary it is to correctly understand its powers and limitations,
                    how it functions and the effect of visualization on the understanding of information. Overall it
                    shows how critical thinking must always be applied, even to the seemingly mundane ways we understand
                    the world through data.
