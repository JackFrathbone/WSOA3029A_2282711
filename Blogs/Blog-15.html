                <h2>Reflection on my Own Data Artwork</h2>
                <p>
                    After spending time reading and researching on data driven art, it was finally time to make my own
                    for the website. As my page with the data is split into various sub-sections, I had the choice to
                    make the artwork relate to either an existing section or a new one. Having just added an interactive
                    map looking at employment in the game industry, I decided to continue on that thread as the map
                    didn't cover all the total amount of jobs and this was information I thought would be quite useful
                    for my overall message. So the data I started with was the total number of employees at game
                    studios, animation studios and the combined total of all digital game and art industries in South
                    Africa. I was directly inspired by a previous blog post looking at the artist Yoshiyuki Mikami and
                    their use of pixelating images to represent the total population of animals depicted in the picture.
                    <br><br>
                    From this core idea I decided to use an image of the South African flag, a simple visual indicator
                    to show the data is for this country, and then pixelated the flag so that the total number of pixels
                    was relatively close to the number of employees. As this was done for three number sets that got
                    higher this meant the flag got less pixelated, and with the smallest flag the pixels are extremely
                    clear and could even be counted by the viewer. This alongside all the other graphs and
                    visualizations pushes the point that the industry is smaller but growing quickly.
                    <br><br>
                    The interactivity of the artwork comes from the ability for the viewer to click on the image and
                    cycle to the next one, so from gaming, to animation, to the combined data sets. This also changes
                    the headings so the data being shown is clear. This turns the image itself into a button and lets
                    the user quickly cycle through all the data and images, seeing how it changes the resolution of the
                    image. Interaction like this, even simple, helps draw the viewer in and connect them to the piece,
                    as well as allowing them to explore and look at the data from different angles (Dimara & Perin,
                    2020). By also keeping the interactivity simple it doesn't distract at all from the data and the art
                    and puts the focus directly on the artwork when it changes.
                    <br><br>
                    One main problem is that the image itself isn't self-explanatory and needs the heading to mention
                    that one pixel represents one job, so the format requires introduction and doesn't have any innate
                    understanding or convention that would help viewers understand it quickly. But it still doesn't
                    require more than a short sentence to explain so this isn't much of an issue. In general I feel this
                    was a relatively simple and effective data driven artwork that helps to reinforce the message of
                    both the sites section and its overall message.
