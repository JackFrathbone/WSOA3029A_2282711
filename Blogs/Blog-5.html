                <h2>A Close Reading of Knaflic’s Dissecting Model Visuals</h2>
                <p>
                    This chapter of Knaflic’s book Storytelling with Data is a look at various successful examples of
                    data visualisation, analysing elements that make it work and relating it to the overall idea of data
                    storytelling that Knaflic discusses in the book. The first example is that of a chart graph that
                    shows the amount of money a charity has raised in the current year at an earlier point, compared to
                    their previous year. Knaflic says that overall this graph works well because of the overall balance
                    of elements. One of those is the fact that a thin small line is used to show the total money goal,
                    which is helpful but because it it's not the primary data, its small size deemphasis it and doest
                    distract the audience from the primary data in the graph.
                    <br><br>
                    The next example also shows a similar lesson to the first, that the emphasis on certain parts of the
                    graph is really important to draw the audience's eyes over the data in the order wanted, and to only
                    focus on secondary elements once the primary ideas of the graph have been seen. Knaflic does go into
                    specifics about his decisions on the elements and how they achieved their goals, such as
                    specifically using a bold font to emphasise specific text that sat next to less important text. The
                    next graph shows some different ideas, having a lot more going on visually with text and different
                    colors, but tight planning of elements allows the main idea to still get through. Knaflic does
                    briefly mention colors and avoids colors that contrast too much, or are too bright, favouring more
                    muted colors than when by themselves still give emphasis without being visually loud.
                    <br><br>
                    Color is brought up again in the second last graph, with Knaflic showing how having both a regular
                    color, and a muted variant of the same color, can be used to show positive and negative axes on a
                    graph more distinctly. He also brings up how a small bold text point, in this case a statement that
                    shows the main point of the graph, demonstrating an ‘unmet gap’ in directors, can help demonstrate
                    the story of the graph easily and contribute to making its messaging extremely clear. The final
                    graph once again shows color usage, this time with color showing emphasis on one part of the graph,
                    the top three bars are blue shades while the rest are grey, which clearly shows the audience which
                    part of the data is important.
                    <br><br>
                    Overall this chapter is really about Knaflic showing how he approaches designing/re-designing graphs
                    to better tell stories and clearly state their intended messages to their intended audience. His
                    examples show how smart usage of color, clearly demarcated different elements with more or less
                    emphasis, can push a graph that simply shows data into one that tells a story through its smart use
                    of visuals.
