                <h2>Self Reflection: Interactive Data Visualisation</h2>
                <p>
                    When approaching my own attempt at an interactive piece of data visualisation, I knew that I wanted
                    something that would be both simple and display a single data point while still using interactivity
                    to clearly show the user the message. In this case the data I chose to use was on the number of game
                    studios in the country, based on the year of their founding, showing the total number of studios by
                    year. This data point was perfect to use an interactive graph for because it wouldn't make sense in
                    any traditional graph format, the point is to show a single number and year at one time.
                    <br><br>
                    I decided to use 10 year intervals from the end date of 2017(how far the data goes), going back to
                    1997. So within three years I got the total number of studios for each of those years, which shows
                    the increase from 1997(6 studios) to 2017(80+ studios). To visualise this I decided on simply using
                    a circle with the number in it, and the size of the circle would grow with the number. Making it
                    interactive raised a lot of different possibilities but both the physicality and intuitiveness of a
                    slider made sense. The slide starts in 1997(the lowest) and goes up two more times till 2017, moving
                    left to right. Alongside the circle growth this made it almost fun to see the growth, and clearly
                    shows the fact that the amount of studios has rapidly and drastically increased.
                    <br><br>
                    Dimara and Perin point out that simplicity is important when making anything interactive, the user
                    should not be overwhelmed with options, and the interactivity should be clear and easy to understand
                    (Dimara & Perin, 2020). With one control that has a clear relation to the data, time moving left to
                    right, the interaction is simple and makes sense. But instead of just using the mouse to hover over
                    years or something like that, the more physical movement of the slider increases the impact of the
                    visual, and thus the data, and makes the user feel more involved than simply magnifying a data point
                    like many other interactive visualisations.
                    <br><br>
                    Overall that's all there is too the visualization, it is meant to make the user stop after the first
                    section, and have to move through the second section of the data without using multiple graphs or
                    visuals, this one interactive piece is supposed to clearly show the growth of the industry without
                    need for extra information, just two number and a slider with a title. The fact that the slider ends
                    at the highest number also helps indicate to the user that the section is finished and it is time to
                    move down to the next section.
