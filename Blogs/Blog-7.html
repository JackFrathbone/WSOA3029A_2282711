                <h2>Self Reflection- My Own Attempt at Data Visualisation</h2>
                <p>
                    Now that I’ve finally begun to create my own graphs and visuals for the website, it's time for me to
                    take all my previous research and writing on dava visualization and apply it to my own work. In case
                    you are reading from the future and I have actually finished all my work, the specific graphs in
                    question that I will be looking at today are the two graphs under the heading ‘Where Are We Making
                    Our Games?’. All of my graphs will be on the homepage on the site, with the plan being that a single
                    continuous page of data will be used to tell my story, so that order and the viewer's eye movement
                    can be used to best tell the story, presenting specific data at the right time.
                    <br><br>
                    To begin, the data being used for these graphs comes from the same report Unlocking the Growth
                    Potential of the Online Gaming Industry in South Africa: Challenges and Opportunities which contains
                    various tables and its own survey results on a wide variety of statistics on the local gaming &
                    animation industry. The specific data I used for these graphs was the geographical stuff, being the
                    location of studios by city and by province, as well as the total number of published games by
                    province. So this data shows which places and regions of the country hold most of our studios, which
                    is a useful bit of data to show. I decided to represent it in two ways, firstly using a bar graph
                    for the total studios, with the graph having a button to switch between city and province. The total
                    published games was displayed on a pie chart.
                    <br><br>
                    The choice of a bar graph was made for the total studios because this was the most important data
                    set for this section, and clarity was needed. A bar graph clearly shows disparity between points.
                    The graph itself is very basic and straightforward, with only one color, red, which comes from the
                    overall site's color palette. The data is very straightforward and does not need much more clarity,
                    but unfortunately due to time constraints adding labels to the axis was not possible, so the title
                    of the graph is the main guide for reading the data. This should be addressed in the future.
                    <br><br>
                    The pie chart was done to just give a different kind of visual, to further show how there is a
                    concentration of work being done in specific provinces, reinforcing the previous data and showing
                    that production wise the Western Cape and Gauteng are the most important areas for the industry, and
                    that other areas are marginal. The chart is very, with basic colors and lacking any form of legend,
                    instead using labels on the chart directly, with the actual specific number attached. It could be
                    alot more evocative or interesting but as is, just reinforces the previous data.
                    <br><br>
                    Fundamentally these charts I think do work in terms of Knafllics whole idea about storytelling with
                    data visualizations, they definitely aren't as nice his professional work, but should be a solid
                    foundation upon which later points of the website can elaborate on the growth of the industry,
                    possibly by exploring more geographic data from which these charts serve as a diving off point
                    (Knafflic, 2015). But they do quite clearly show the big picture about the data, and especially with
                    the pie chart are evocative in the difference between the smaller regions and the biggest producers.
                    <br><br>
                    Both charts are interesting in terms of representation, as discussed in ‘Theories of
                    Representation’, understanding different of marginalisation is important to start enacting any sort
                    of change, and seeing clearly how there are certain regions that tend to have the majority of work,
                    while others only have a few studios or published works (Kidd, 2015). Hopefully this can be explored
                    in greater detail in later sections.
