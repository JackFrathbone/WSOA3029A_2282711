                <h2>An Analysis of Playfair’s Graph</h2>
                <p>
                    This weeks post will be looking a historic piece of data visualization, specifically the 1821 graph
                    by William Playfair which shows “prices, wages, and ruling monarch over
                    a 250 year period” (Playfair in Friendly, 2008: 10). This graph is a very interesting one to look at
                    because of its point in history, but also its surprisingly modern look. As discussed by Friendly in
                    ‘a Brief History of Data Visualization’ Playfair was a very significant person in the history of
                    data visualization, being the credited inventor of the bar chart and the line graph. These forms of
                    data visaution are extremely common today and used in many places, and Playfair's example seems so
                    modern and straightforward because our own current understanding comes directly from the work he did
                    (Friendly, 2008).
                    <br><br>
                    What stands out about Playfair's graph primarily is its use of all axes on the graph, instead of the
                    typical and more clear two axes of most modern graphs and charts. This particular graph has: a top
                    axis of curved lines which show different centuries, from the last half of the 16th century to the
                    first half of the 19th; a bottom axis showing the specific years; a left and right axis which deal
                    with prices of wheat and the average wage; a series of lines at the top of the graph showing British
                    monarchs by years reigned. This seems a lot of information for one graph, but being split into a
                    line and bar section makes it a bit more legible. The purpose of the graph is supposedly to
                    demonstrate that “workers had become better off in the most recent years” (Friendly, 2008: 8).
                    <br><br>
                    Overall the graph is legible, and seems to make its point, but the large amount of information being
                    shown does take away from the clarity of the graph, requiring closer reading and examination to
                    really understand what is happening. It is interesting how the same sort of information is presented
                    multiple times, that is chronological data, with the year, the century, and the reigning monarch all
                    being chronologically relevant data. But having all of it displayed at once, instead of just doing
                    the graph by year or monarch, just means that instead of showing a highly specific point, like
                    attributing growing wages to a specific monarch or time period, it is less clear the exact story or
                    point the graph is trying to make. But really in all other ways the graph really isn't that bad,
                    just unfocused and not as straightforward and direct as a modern day one would be, cutting down to
                    just the normal two axes and splitting the two parts into their own separate graphs would be much
                    more effective at putting a point across.
