                <h2>Critical Reflection: My Own Data-Driven Artwork</h2>
                <p>
                    While I will talk more specifically about my data-driven artwork, its elements and how it
                    specifically functions in a later blogspot, this particular post is focused on describing my
                    approach to making the artwork. I tried to use previous ideas about representation and data
                    storytelling to communicate my message with this artwork.
                    <br><br>
                    In short my artwork is a sequence(three parts) of square South African flags, which go from most to
                    least pixelated, with each pixel representing a single employee approximately. Pixels can’t be
                    divided and the image needed to be square so they are all a little smaller than the exact number of
                    people, but get across the general size of the game, animation and combined digital art industries
                    of South Africa. The user clicks on the image to cycle through to the next one, and there is a
                    heading explaining the data, an instruction(click the image) as well as a mention of its scale (one
                    pixel is one employee).
                    <br><br>
                    The images attempt to communicate via semiotics the size of a particular industry, by using the
                    commonly understood concept of scale representing actual size (Kidd, 2015). In this case the
                    resolution of the image, how pixelated it is, stands in for the scale with fewer pixels showing a
                    higher number of employees. This scale, once understood by the audience through reading the heading,
                    allows the audience to understand how the segments of the industry and the total combined number all
                    relate to each other, and how their scales compare. This scale is the primary communication with the
                    audience and follows Knaflic’s ideas about focusing data on the key points and not distracting with
                    extraneous options or points (Knaflic, 2015).
                    <br><br>
                    The main goal of the artwork was to be very simple, to understand and to interact with, so as to
                    clearly show its message but not distract the viewer from the surrounding and previous data points.
                    So the artwork not being flashy, complicated or having a variety of buttons and settings lets it fit
                    in with the surrounding graphs, while functioning differently enough to be memorable. The audience
                    ends on this point and interaction and viewing, with the growing scale, helps the audience digest
                    the core message of optimistic growth the rest of the data is pushing. The actual numbers are also
                    part of the heading but the image itself is designed to be clear enough to be understood without
                    needing any specific number, Being able to see each pixel in sequence shows the audience how the
                    industry is relatively small despite how much is to growing as shown in previous sections, and that
                    with only a few more people added the industry could grown even more rapidly.
