                <h2>Information is Beautiful – Interactivity as Semiotic Device</h2>
                <p>
                    (<a
                        href="https://infobeautiful4.s3.amazonaws.com/2020/03/Coronavirus-COVID19-riskiest-activities-03.png">https://infobeautiful4.s3.amazonaws.com/2020/03/Coronavirus-COVID19-riskiest-activities-03.png</a>)
                    <br>
                    Looking once again at Information Is Beautiful, but his time looking at a different aspect of how a
                    data visualization communicates ideas. The selected visualization this week is one on ‘Coronavirus
                    Riskiest Activities’ which contains a series of circles grouped into low risk, medium risk, and high
                    risk, as well as color coded from yellow to dark red to show how risky they are.
                    <br><br>
                    This graph will be specifically analysed in terms of semiotics, which is the study of signs and how
                    they convey meanings (Kidd, 2015). A semiotic device is something that conveys meaning through a
                    common visual understanding of signs. All data visualisations rely on semiotic devices in some
                    capacity, because they have to use widely understood visual queues to let the viewer know the
                    meaning of the visual and with minimal explanation. A graph like the information beautiful one
                    contains many such ‘hidden’ meanings that are not explicitly described but are expected to be
                    understood by the viewer and communicate the ideas of the graph. This is seen clearly in the use of
                    circles and their color coding, while the yellow to red gradient is not explicitly stated as a low
                    to high risk indicator, the meaning of the color red is clear because of its strong association with
                    both danger, risk and indicating a higher amount than a more neutral color like yellow. Those
                    circles which contain a gradient between yellow and red are also more clearly in the middle.
                    <br><br>
                    So this graph visually shows the increase in risk, even inside the three groups, without having to
                    explicitly state it because of how people automatically interpret the signs. Even the obvious use of
                    circles themselves indicate closed off and separate activities, it is clear that it is a collection
                    of activities that do not relate to each other but only to the increase in risk. There is also a
                    minor use of size, which is a very straightforward semiotic device, bigger items will be more
                    prominent, seem more important, and in the graphs case indicate the activities with the highest
                    risk, being the ones the viewer is supposed to see and remember to avoid. All this is communicated
                    clearly with just the title of the graph, making sense before the keys or legends are even read.
                    <br><br>
                    By better understanding how people read and understand semiotic devices, how signs and visuals can
                    hold implicit meanings, graphs can better communicate and even hold more information without
                    requiring the addition of unnecessary descriptions. For example it is clear that nightclubs hold the
                    highest risk, out of all the high risk activities, without needing a scale or some sort of number to
                    compare between it and all the other circles.
