                <h2>A Close Analysis of the Itch.io Homepage</h2>
                <p>
                    This week I am looking at a website I commonly use and critically analysing all of its design
                    elements, from its UI, its layout and flow, to its overall user experience(UX). For this I decided
                    to look at Itch.io, which is a website I commonly use and check up on, and which I think is also
                    very interesting to analyze because of how it works. Itch.io is primarily a storefront, or a
                    catalogue, of independently made(indie) games, where users can freely host games for free, and are
                    allowed to freely put a price tag on their work. I say primarily for games because it also has other
                    stuff it hosts, such as tools for game and digital development, resources for board games, and an
                    entire social featureset where game competitions and events can be hosted.
                    <br><br>
                    The homepage will be the focus of this blog, as this is the portal that is supposed to bring users
                    to all other locations on the site. Starting with an overall glance the site can be divided into a
                    topbar, a sidebar, and a grid which takes up the majority of the space. This grid itself is
                    subdivided into labelled sections, such as ‘Latest Featured Games’ or genres or user specific
                    collections of titles recommended based on previous browsing. At the top of the grid is a featured
                    game of the day which takes up an entire row, thus taking up the largest amount of screen space and
                    attention of the user. This grid can be scrolled down for a bit, going beyond just being one full
                    screen's worth of content. The topbar contains links to stuff for the user's account, as well as
                    links to broad sections of the website like ‘community’ and ‘feed’. The sidebar is more specifically
                    focused on browsing the sites catalogue showing various options for sorting out a search, such as by
                    genre, by tag or by price. It also has links at the bottom to the website's official blog posts.
                    <br><br>
                    Looking at this page as a total unit, it is clear that it draws the users focus directly to the
                    catalogue, and that this the primary purpose for which most of the buttons and options are designed
                    for. It takes up the most screen space, with a visually driven UI that displays photos for every
                    game and tool, with a mouse over producing a popup that shows more media from the specific game, as
                    well as animating the display photo into a gif or movie. Hassenzahl and Tractinsky speak about how
                    UX is more than just functional layout but also has an aesthetic element to guide, reward and
                    interest the user in specific elements. Itch.io does this through it’s media driven displaying of
                    games, giving both its featured, and all of its catalogue, a space to show a visual representation
                    of the games, with user interest (in the form of a mouse over) getting rewarded with a more detail
                    view of the visual and more visuals popping up. The games could be simply displayed as text with a
                    small photo or logo, but as a visual medium they are well served with highly visual spots in the
                    catalogue.
                    <br><br>
                    To quickly speak on the point of representation, as raised by Kidd in their book on representation,
                    this is something that is actually fairly important to think about with a storefront like itch.io
                    that seeks to represent alternative and independent games (Kidd, 2015). The featured games of the
                    day are curated by the team behind itch.io, they select a game based on personal knowledge, access
                    to the author or various other somewhat opaque roads. This means there is power and importance
                    behind the games itch.io decides are worth featuring, and what it says about their storefront as a
                    whole, who is welcome there and who is not. So this simple list of games that pops up everyday could
                    be a tool for positive representation or a way of gatekeeping out games the team might think don’t
                    fit the brand of itch.io, for better or worse. Understanding the role of this feature is very useful
                    for future analysis of how well the site does this.
