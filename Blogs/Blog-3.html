                <h2>An Analysis of My Own Website Design</h2>
                <p>
                    After previously looking at another website's design and layout, this week it's my turn to look
                    inwards and critically analyse the design of my own website. While as I'm writing this I don't have
                    a website up yet, so I will be going over my wireframe plan for the site which covers all the design
                    and layout choices I have made so far. So anything I state here is probably subject to change as my
                    site goes live and I adjust parts of my design in response to reality website design over my plans,
                    but overall the structure should mostly be intact.
                    <br><br>
                    Firstly, it is important to understand the context of my website. The focus I am going for is on
                    visualizing data on the topic of the game development industry in South Africa, using data from the
                    South African Cultural Observatory. This data talks about the growth, revenue, size and future
                    directions of the game industry in South Africa, and the site will seek to use this data to tell a
                    story about the industry, show how it has grown and the geographical location of South Africans
                    studios. So primarily the site will focus on showing this data, visually, and with accompanied text
                    and images to engage the viewer. It will also house these blogs in a separate section, alongside the
                    usual website requirements like a contact and ‘about us’ page. It will also have a page dedicated to
                    credits for all of the external assets used.
                    <br><br>
                    As seen below in image 1 the site will have a very simple navigation bar, basically just a white
                    space with a large distinct font for the website title, with thinner text for the links to each
                    page. These links will become bold and underlined when the mouse goes over them, in order to clearly
                    show they are selected. The overall look of the homepage is focused on visual clarity and
                    minimalism, putting all the focus on the content. The site overall uses a four colour palette for
                    everything(red, yellow, purple and white), with purple being used as a frame for all content, always
                    clearly showing what is the body opr article of the specific page. Both the text and any visuals in
                    the body of the site is intended to have a white colour, or white background to make them clearly
                    stand out from the purple background and highlight them as being the content. All pages will follow
                    a similar layout to the homepage with a purple body and white content, with the heading of the page
                    always being large and in yellow.
                    <br><br>
                    Hassenzahl and Tractinsky, when talking about UX, describe it as a design focus that moves beyond
                    functionality to address the experience of pleasurable user experience and the aesthetic qualities
                    of an interface (Hassenzahl & Tractinsky, 2006). Functionally my website is straightforward, it just
                    need to display data on a single page that scrolls down, but to create a positive user experience it
                    is also necessary to consider the pleasure of using the site, with the current idea to have a smooth
                    scroll on the homepage where the various graphs and image will enlarge as you scroll over them,
                    showing text and detail, and then shrinking down when you move on to the next section. Alongside the
                    simple yet colourful visuals this should help emphasize the data and put it and the accompanying
                    text front and centre for the user.
