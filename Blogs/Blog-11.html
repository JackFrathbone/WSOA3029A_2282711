                <h2>Close Reading: How Art Can Contribute to Ethical Reflection on Risky Technologies</h2>
                <p>
                    This week's blog is looking at an article which discusses the role that art can play when it comes
                    to understanding new technologies. This article by Sabine Roeser starts by raising the fact that
                    current debates on risky new technology are limited because it can be hard for people to understand
                    or reflect fairly on risky technologies due simply to how new and different they may be (Roeser,
                    2016). So Roeser proposes the idea that art may have a role to play in these debates by helping to
                    better portray and understand risky technologies in ways which lets people reflect better on them.
                    This art is what Roeser refers to as ‘techno-art’.
                    <br><br>
                    Techno-art, according to Roeser, is art that “reflects on and engages with risky technology” (Roser,
                    2016: 127). This is to counter the fact that people generally tend to be more critical of new
                    technology due to historical ideas that new technology is more risky and dangerous, so by exploring
                    it fully with techno-art new perspectives can be raised and the abilities of the new technology can
                    be better shown. This is demonstrated by raising historical examples of art that was closely related
                    to technological advances, and how this sold ideas to the public and sought to improve perceptions
                    of how technology would affect people.
                    <br><br>
                    Roeser shows a contemporary example with the performance artist Stelarc who has held many shows on
                    body modification, including his attachment of a real cell grown ear to his arm. The point of these
                    performers is to show the possibilities and ethical dangers of these new technologies, to understand
                    the human limits in ways which scientific papers and research can't fully capture. This shows an
                    example of how art can better explore these issues in a way audiences can understand, whereas a
                    purely scientific approach does not necessarily have the tools to deal with societal and ethical
                    implications of technology. This is a way that techno-artists can be involved in a process of public
                    deliberation and shape the narrative.
                    <br><br>
                    There are challenges to this approach which Roeser acknowledges, specifically around how artists may
                    portray technologies and when they don't fully understand it themselves. Artists aren't held to the
                    same ethical standards as scientists and naturally have more room to create and speak, which means
                    they can be involved in risky technologies without the same expectations, which could be bad. They
                    can also purposely or accidentally misrepresent technology and make the argument too emotionally
                    focused and based on unrealistic expectations.
                    <br><br>
                    Roeser finished the article by stating support for techno-art but warning it faces many challenges.
                    But it is something that exists and understanding it is important to further understand the debates
                    around risky technologies. As new complex technologies come to shape our lives and the world we live
                    in, it is important for artists to breakdown, analyse and critique these new technologies and bring
                    up the ethical implications of accepting risky new technologies, and by bringing in more
                    perspectives to these debates allow more nuanced and developed viewpoints about the future we want
                    to be developed.
