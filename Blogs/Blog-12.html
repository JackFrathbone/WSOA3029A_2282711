                <h2>Reflection on a Data-Driven Artwork</h2>
                <p>
                    (<a
                        href="https://petapixel.com/2019/10/01/photos-of-endangered-species-where-every-pixel-represents-one-animal/">https://petapixel.com/2019/10/01/photos-of-endangered-species-where-every-pixel-represents-one-animal/</a>)
                    <br>
                    Data-driven art is quite a wide and complicated field with some examples being quite simple and just
                    using technology to drive a point in, while others exist more to demonstrate a technology through
                    the use of art. This week's piece to look at is more of the former, with both data, technology and
                    art being combined to push a point about endangered animals. This project by Yoshiyuki Mikami just
                    takes photos of various endangered animals like black rhinos or tigers, and runs them through an
                    image editing program which takes in a number, based on the amount of that species that exists in
                    the wild, then changes the resolution of the image to match that total number.
                    <br><br>
                    This program thus makes an image of an animal representative of the amount of it left, with each
                    pixel in the image corresponding to one animal in the wild. Thus each image not only clearly shows
                    the total amount of that species left, but also gets more blurry and harder to clearly see as the
                    species gets more endangered, with some pictures being completely distorted by how small the number
                    is. This clearly communicates how endangered and at risk that animal is.
                    <br><br>
                    In terms of communicating the idea of the project, this is a really successful piece of data-driven
                    art, turning what is a relatively abstract number (50,000 elephants vs 5000 elephants) into a
                    tangible image with a strong impact, it communicates to the viewer that the endangered species is
                    literally disappearing before our eyes. It is a literal message which reinforces the real issue that
                    is occurring. So the digital depiction helps understand the meaning of the data while not changing
                    its core message, and also serves as a much quicker way of getting across the meaning as compared to
                    an article explaining how bad these numbers are and what they mean for these species. It shows the
                    power of data art to communicate certain ideas much more clearly than either the straight up data or
                    verbal/textual communication.
                    <br><br>
                    One issue with artworks like this is that sometimes it can be hard to create context if people don't
                    really understand the technology and how it works. For example if someone was completely unfamiliar
                    with digital images they might not really get what a pixel is, but this is quite unlikely with this
                    piece, but more complicated and especially interactive pieces could overwhelm or confuse some
                    people. If a piece requires a tutorial or explanation before use, it might become too difficult to
                    actually get its own point across.
